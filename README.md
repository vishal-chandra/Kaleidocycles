# Kaleidocycles
This is a project to simulate and design Kaleidocycles through various boolean solid operations (subtraction, union, intersection). Basic Kaleidocycles can "sculpted" using various tools such as cones, cylinders, and prisms. <br>
Made possible by Three.js (see below), the simulation follows the equations explained in [this paper](res/kaleidocycles_theory.pdf) to model Kaleidocyclic behavior both before and after the sculpting process.

### Math Tools & Theory
[3D Reflection Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Reflection_2). The kaleidocycle itself is an illusion â€“ a single base unit is simply rotated around the z axis and reflected across the approriate planes successively to mimic the appearance of a physical kaleidocycle.<br>
[Transformation Debugging](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a0a1wpo2ib). A simple tool to step through the governing equations.
